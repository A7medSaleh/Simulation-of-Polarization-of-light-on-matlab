Polarization (also polarisation) is a property applying to transverse waves that specifies the geometrical orientation of the oscillations. In a transverse wave, the direction of the oscillation is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction.

Study of polarization of light has many applications like the principle of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology which relies on the rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array and ellipsometry characterization technique and many other applications.

This code simulates the polarization of waves by adding two components and see the polarization effect of changing the properties of these two components. The code make accurate simulation by real time steps. It works on matlab and made in GUI interface to be easy to use.
